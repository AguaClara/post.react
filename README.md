Coding Conventions:
  Variables should be in CamelCase
    e.g. flowRate aguaClara
  Constants should be in all caps
    e.g. HEIGHT, WIDTH
  Indentations should be equivalent to 2 spaces
  There should be white space between terms
    x = 1 + 1 instead of x=1+1
  Opening braces should be on the same line as the statement
    if (bool) {
        code();
    }
